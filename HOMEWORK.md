# Adam's homework for this project

Remove the remaining references to `rain`, `alien`, `ship`, `bullet` in the *.py files.

## The problem

There are still references to  `rain`, `alien`, `ship`, `bullet` in the *.py scripts. These artifacts of the alien invasion game are either unncessary or will cause the program to break (or both) in this catch game.

### The solution

Use [the search results made by Mavaddat](./_alien_ship_bullet_rain_.code-search) to ensure that there are not any such references to  `rain`, `alien`, `ship`, `bullet` remaining in the *.py scripts.

Go through the scripts and search for these keywords. Remove the ones that need to be removed and replace the ones that need to be replaced
